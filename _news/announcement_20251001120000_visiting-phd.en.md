I have started a Visiting PhD period at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://people.epfl.ch/mirko.casu?lang=en)), in Lausanne, Switzerland. I will be working under the supervision of [Prof. Andrea Cavallaro](https://people.epfl.ch/andrea.cavallaro) and joining the [LIDIAP](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/idiap/) research group.
