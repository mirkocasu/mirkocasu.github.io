I have started a Visiting PhD period at the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), in Lausanne, Switzerland. I will be working under the supervision of Prof. Andrea Cavallaro and joining the LIDIAP research group.

I am excited to collaborate with the LIDIAP team and to contribute to ongoing research during this visiting period.
