Hello there! I'm a clinical psychologist and a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Catania, where I work on the [SiciliAn MicronanOTecH Research And Innovation CEnter](https://samothrace.eu/) (SAMOTHRACE) project and am a member of the [Multimedia Security & Forensics](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/mfs/) group at the [Image Processing Laboratory](https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/) (IPLab). My interdisciplinary research connects psychology with technology, exploring artificial intelligence, deepfakes, cognitive bias, digital forensics, eHealth, mHealth, and virtual reality applications.

Previously, I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Psychological Science from the [University of Sassari](https://www.uniss.it/en) in 2019, and a Master's Degree in Clinical Psychology from the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it/en) in 2023. My internships focused on Lacanian psychoanalytic, cognitive-behavioral, and systemic-relational approaches.
